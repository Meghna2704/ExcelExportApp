# ExcelExportApp
This is a demo asp.net core console application which is used to fetch the data from the Database using SQL Server and export it in an Excel file. This application uses Mini Excel to work with Excel Files and exports 5 million records with 1 million records on a single sheet. For detailed explanation, please refer my medium article <a href="https://medium.com/@meghnav274/export-millions-of-records-in-excel-from-sql-server-using-asp-net-core-07cb2de979a0"> Export millions of records in Excel from SQL Server. </a> Also, you will need to update the App.config file with your connection string.
